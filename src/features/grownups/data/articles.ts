## Why AI Makes Scams More Dangerous

AI didn't invent scams — but it made them faster, cheaper, and much harder to spot. A scammer who once needed hours to craft a convincing email can now generate thousands of personalised messages in seconds.

Here is what has changed:

- **Voice cloning**: 3 seconds of audio is enough to clone a person's voice with modern AI models
- **Deepfake video**: Real-time face-swapping runs on a standard laptop
- **Automated phishing**: LLMs write personalised, grammatically perfect lures at scale
- **Impersonation at scale**: AI monitors your social media to craft contextually relevant messages

## How a Modern AI Scam Works

1. Scammer collects public data about you (social media, public records)
2. AI generates a personalised, believable message using that data
3. You receive contact that feels specific and trustworthy
4. If you respond, data or money is stolen — if not, the scammer moves to the next target

## The Three Red Flags

Most AI scams share three patterns regardless of how they are delivered:

**1. Urgency pressure**

"Act now or lose access." "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours." Urgency bypasses slow, critical thinking and activates fast, reactive decision-making.

**2. Unusual payment or data request**

Legitimate organisations never ask for gift cards, crypto, or one-time passwords over an unsolicited contact — ever.

**3. Too-good or too-bad to be true**

Both extremes are designed to create emotional override — either excitement (prize won) or fear (account hacked). Emotion is the exploit.

## The Pause Protocol

The best defence is a simple three-step pause:

1. **Stop** — do not click, call back, or respond immediately
2. **Verify independently** — use a number or URL you looked up yourself, not one they gave you
3. **Ask someone** — scammers rely on isolation; talking to another person breaks the spell

## Voice Clone Red Flags

A real-time voice clone can be convincing but still shows tells:

- Slight audio artefacts or unnatural pauses
- Can't answer personal questions you'd both know (shared memories, last time you met)
- Refuses a video call or face-to-face

If something feels off, it probably is. Trust your instinct and verify through a separate channel.

## Summary

AI has industrialised scamming. The tactics are old — urgency, impersonation, trust exploitation. The scale and personalisation are new. Recognition is your first line of defence, and a 30-second pause is the most powerful tool you have.

## Why AI Changes Financial Forecasting

Traditional forecasting depends on historical averages, linear trend lines, and analyst intuition. AI doesn't replace that — it augments it. The key shift is moving from static models to adaptive ones that update as new data arrives.

## The Forecasting Stack

1. Raw financial data (CSV / ERP / spreadsheet)
2. Data cleaning and feature engineering
3. A regression model or time-series ML model
4. An LLM narrative layer that explains the numbers
5. A forecast report with scenarios

## Step 1: Prepare Your Data

The model is only as good as the input. Before touching any AI:

- **Normalise dates** — consistent YYYY-MM-DD across all rows
- **Handle missing values** — forward-fill for sparse periods, flag for genuine gaps
- **Create lag features** — last month's revenue, 3-month rolling average, YoY delta

## Step 2: Choose Your Model

For most finance practitioners, three models cover 90% of use cases:

| Model | Best For | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Linear Regression | Trend + seasonality, explainable | Low |
| XGBoost | Complex patterns, feature interactions | Medium |
| Prophet (Meta) | Time-series with holidays, events | Low |

Start with Prophet for monthly data — it handles seasonality natively.

## Step 3: Add an LLM Narrative Layer

Numbers without narrative don't get actioned. Use an LLM to:

- Summarise what drove the variance vs. budget
- Flag anomalies in plain English before the numbers hit the board
- Generate scenario descriptions ("If Q3 headcount grows 10%...")

> Prompt: "Given these monthly actuals vs. forecast: [data table], write a 3-bullet CFO summary highlighting the top variance drivers and any risks for Q4. Keep it under 100 words."

## Summary

AI forecasting is not about replacing the analyst — it is about giving them better inputs faster. Start with clean data, a simple model, and an LLM narrative layer. Complexity comes later; value comes first.
